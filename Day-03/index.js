// Operator - Symbols - that you apply on something to carr out a calculation.for different kind of operations you have different kind of operator .. so to perform an operaton you need a symbol that we call as operator .

// Operands - these are the values on which your operator works on.

// Expression - expression is something which resolve to a value .

// x = 2 - you are assigning a value to x .

// expression is something which can resolve to a value .

// let x = 4 + 5; // this is expression - inside this expression too many things are happening .

// use the operands and operator together to get another value as a output - this also called expression .

// Expression can Resolve to a Value .

// 3 + 4 - this is called evaluating expression

//types of operator

// Arithmetic
// Assignment
// Comparision
// Relational
// Logical
// Bitwise
// Conditional
// Grouping
// type of
// instance of

// Arithmatic Operator .

let a = 10;

console.log(a + b); // 30
console.log(a - b); // -10
console.log(b - a); // 10
console.log(a * b); // 200
console.log(a / b); // 0.5

// String Concatination

let f_name = 10;
let l_name = 20;

console.log(f_name + l_name);

// exponential Operator (**)

console.log(a ** b); // 10 t0 the power 20

// Post Increment 

// count++ it will return the value first then it increments thr value 

// ++count it will increment the value then it will return. 

// similarly there is post and pre decrement as well .
